
1. 4 of hearts and 6 of spades, 5 of clubs and 5 of diamonds

2. Yes because all possible combinations of 10 have been completed except the final one, J K and Q

3. There should be no strategy because you have an equal chance of getting any card (that you do not already have or have discarded) when you pull from the deck randomly. You also may have a more possible route to victory simply by drawing a better hand in the begining because you may have more than one combination of ten meaning that you will not have to risk randomizing. That means that four or more cards could be out of the way by the first few turns.
